## Reflection
In this course, I was hoping to get a deeper understanding about the technology and information system by going through different timelines of technology development. This project has impacted me greatly by helping me understand how to implement the design thinking technique in this field and acknowledging the issues and solutions that can be affected by the development of technology. I will continue taking the initiative to understand more about this industry and relate the newest development of technology into my life and find ways to implement design thinking when faced with a problem.
